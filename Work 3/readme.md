Stack & Queue Project (Rwanda Context)

Project Name: Stack & Queue Concepts ‚Äì Practical & Ethical Applications

Objective: Explore stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) operations through practical, challenge-based, and reflective questions grounded in Rwandan real-life settings like UR, Irembo, Airtel, CHUK, and public transport.

‚úÖ Key Learning Outcomes:

Stack Operations:

Push/pop tasks

Real-world use (e.g., form filling)

Reversing data (e.g., words)

Understanding fairness issues in LIFO systems

Queue Operations:

Serve in order

Track positions after dequeue

Circular queue logic for repeated loops

Ethical fairness via FIFO model

Ideal For: Students and beginners learning data structures using relatable and real-world examples.

üìù Small Note: Stack & Queue Project Summary

This project explores Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) using practical examples from Rwanda (UR, Irembo, Airtel, CHUK).

Stack lets the last task done first (e.g., undo, form filling).

Queue serves in the order of arrival (e.g., clients, patients).
We also learned how LIFO can be unfair in service and how FIFO ensures fairness.
Circular queues help reuse space efficiently‚Äîperfect for looping services like buses.
